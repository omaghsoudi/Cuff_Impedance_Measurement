# Cuff-Impedance-Measurement

This repository is based on our pulished work by the Journal of NeuroScience Methods, 2018.
It can measure the impedance of electrical cuffs and electrodes and fit the measured data to simplified Randles model.


Please check the follwoing paper for more details:

To run the code, you need to open "GUI_Cuff.m" in Matlab. It has been tested in Matlab R2017b and 2016b.
