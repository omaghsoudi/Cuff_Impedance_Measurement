# Open-source Matlab based software to measure impedance of electrical cuffs or electrodes 

This repository is based on our pulished work by the Journal of NeuroScience Methods, 2018.
It can measure the impedance of electrical cuffs and electrodes and fit the measured data to simplified Randles model.


Please check the follwoing paper for more details about the parameters, modes for running the code, and fitting method:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.06.020



To run the code, you need to open "GUI_Cuff.m" in Matlab. It has been tested in Matlab 2016b and R2017b.

The following link contains a sample file recorded from a cuff:

It can be copied into the code directory, or it can be loaded from any directory while running the code.
